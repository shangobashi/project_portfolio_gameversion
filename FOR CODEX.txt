FOR CODEX

TASK

You are expanding an existing top-down, 16×16, pixel-perfect game by creating a town outside the player’s house.

You must steal the essence of Eastward and Sea of Stars — design philosophy only, not assets, layouts, or motifs — and distill it into a town that fits this world.

You are responsible for:

spatial layout

flow and pacing

mystery and revelation

defining exact asset needs

integrating assets once generated

You are not responsible for drawing pixels.

HARD CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)

Tile size: 16×16

Camera: top-down orthographic

Rendering: pixel-perfect

Do not change player scale, movement, or collision rules

Do not introduce isometric or perspective tricks

Do not expose the entire town at once

Do not invent assets without declaring them in a manifest

WORLD PHILOSOPHY (MANDATORY)
Interior vs Exterior Rule

Inside the house: safe, warm, legible

Outside the house: mysterious, quiet, slightly uncanny

The exterior world must feel:

older than the player

partially obscured

calm but not fully explained

Mystery comes from structure, occlusion, and silence, not enemies or fog.

TOWN DESIGN PRINCIPLES
1. Spatial Structure (Eastward-derived)

The town is not one open map

It is a sequence of bounded spaces:

a path

a bend

a courtyard

a narrow street

Use buildings, trees, walls, elevation bands to block sightlines

The player must never see the whole town at once

2. Occlusion & Layering

Foreground layers are intentional:

roofs

trees

arches

Player may pass partially behind objects

What is hidden matters as much as what is shown

3. Composition (Sea-of-Stars-derived)

Treat each screen as a composed image

Limit tile variety per screen

Avoid visual noise

Use negative space deliberately

COLOR & LIGHTING RULES
Palette

Exterior palette: cooler, muted, restrained

Interior palette: warmer, higher contrast

Palette shifts must be gradual, never abrupt

Lighting

Lighting is emotional, not realistic

Use:

warm windows

dim lamps

subtle ambient tint

No full-screen brightness

Darkness is allowed and encouraged

NPC DESIGN

Fewer NPCs, more intention

NPCs belong to spaces, not mechanics

Idle animations only, subtle

Dialogue (if any) is mundane or oblique

NPCs must not explain the town

CONSTRUCTION HEURISTICS (MANDATORY)
A. Screen Budget Rule

Each screen may introduce one new idea only:

a prop type

a structure

a lighting cue

B. Occlusion-First Rule

Decide what a screen hides before decorating it.

C. Landmark Scarcity

One true landmark in the town

Do not explain it

D. Exit Pressure

The town should subtly suggest paths outward, not inward.

REQUIRED OUTPUTS
1. Town Layout

Map structure compatible with the existing engine

Clear screen/area boundaries

Entry, progression, exit logic

2. ASSET MANIFEST (CRITICAL)

Produce a strict asset manifest listing only what is required, e.g.:

ASSET SET: Town Exterior v1

Tile size: 16x16
Palette: exterior_cool_v1

Ground:
- grass_base (2 variants)
- dirt_path (3 variants, seamless)

Structures:
- house_small_A (roof occludes player)
- house_medium_B

Props:
- lamp_post_lit
- wooden_sign_blank
- crate_stack

Nature:
- tree_canopy_foreground
- bush_low

NPCs:
- villager_idle_A


No asset outside this list may be used.

3. Integration Notes

Foreground vs background usage

Collision expectations

Palette usage per area

FINAL SELF-CHECK (REQUIRED)

Answer in comments:

What does this town refuse to show?

Where is the player guided without being told?

Which screen works even if all NPCs are removed?

If unsure, revise.

Ship only when all answers are clear.
